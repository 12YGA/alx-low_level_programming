0. Multiple mains -> Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
1. Like, comment, subscribe -> Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. 0 > 972? -> This program prints the largest of three integers.
3. Leap year -> This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000. That doesn’t seem right
